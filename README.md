Module 10: Object Oriented Progamming Team Profile Generator Challenge

## Description 

Wish there was an application where you were able to enter in information about your team's employees that displays in a nicely formatted team roster? Well now there is! This Team Profile Generator provides users with a webpage that displays summaries about your employees based on the information you provide in this command-line application. It prompts the user with a series of questions about the employee that then quickly generates an HTML webpage. 


To see a sample team profile generated by the application, go into the 'dist' folder on this GitHub repo and open the 'index.html' file.
